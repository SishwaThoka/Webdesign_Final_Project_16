# Webdesign_Final_Project_16


To begin contributing to this project, go through the steps below:

1. Clone the project using SSH, or via HTTPS by running this command:

    > git clone git@github.com:SishwaThoka/Webdesign_Final_Project_16.git
    
2. Pull / create a new branch with the collaborator's name: 

    > git checkout -b <nameofauthor>-web-submission 
    
3. For good practice, do ensure that your branch is up to date with main by merging code locally. 
    > git checkout main  
    > git pull  
    > git checkout <your_branch>  
    > git merge main  
    
4. Always push commits(with relevant description) to your remote branch, before merging with main. If on collaborator branch, simply run:  
    > git pull origin main  
    > git commit -m "<yourCommitMessageHere>"  
    > git push
